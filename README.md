# ansible-pmm-server-k8s

**Currently this repository is a placeholder.**

Ansible role to run PMM Server on Kubernetes.


## Requisites

Kubernetes is required. This role was initially developed for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo).

Ansible version: 2.9.


## Variables

A PMM Server and all the clients connecting to it should form a hostgroup.
These variables should be specified at group level. This will allow us to specify
this information once, and make it available to all hosts that need it.

* `pmm_server_host`: PMM Server IP or hostname. Hint: you may want to specify this in your inventory.
* `pmm_server_port`: PMM Server port. Hint: you may want to specify this in your inventory.
* `pmm_server_user`: Username used by PMM Clients to access PMM Server.
* `pmm_server_password`: Password for `pmm_server_user`.
